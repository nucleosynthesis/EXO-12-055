Type B:

- l230: Is the choice really conservative? Is there an alternative choice that is (maybe not conservative, but) more exact?

=> Yes, its conservative in the sense that the expected sensitivity is worse by decorrelating. This decision was the result of a long discussion of the treatment of the EWK uncertainty that was resolved by this choice. Its clear other potential options are possible. 

- l267: Are the limits given at 90% CL to compare directly to the direct detection experiments? Are also plots at 95% CL available as supplement material?

=> Yes, 90% is done to compare with Direct detection, this is now stated in the paper. We don't have 95% CL avaible.  

Type A:

- Abstract: "with a large missing transverse" : delete "a"
=> Updated

- Abstract: "at centre-of-mass energy" --> "at a centre-of-mass energy"
=> Updated

- l2: here "dark matter" but in l55 & l67 "Dark Matter"
=> Switched to lower case
- l3: introduce "pp", i.e. "in proton-proton (pp) collisions"
=> Updated

- l7 "standard model (SM) *of particle physics*"
=> Updated
- l10-11: "while mono-V, V=W or Z boson, searches": sounds not very elegant, rephrase it
=> We prefer to leave it as is (this was  comment from the LE)

- l23-24 the sentence is somehow broken
=> Fixed

- l30: "Section 5" --> "and Section 5"
=> We prefer to leave it as is (no commas here)

- l34 define p_T?
=> Added

- l52: add space after "mediator" and the parenthesis
=> Added

- l54 denotes -> denote
=> Added

- l62/63: "to the scalar and pseudoscalar can": a substantive is missing, e.g. "to the scalar and pseudoscalar interactions can"
=> Added

- l77: "simulation events" --> "simulated events"
=> Added

- Fig. 1: distinguish between "X" scalar mediator in (a,b) and "X" vector mediator in (c) using different labels and/or line styles?
=> We distinguish now in the figures to mimic the terms in the lagrangians 

- l92: "only using" --> "using only"
=> Its only using in this case to be correct 

- l92: "information from the calorimeter" --> "information from the calorimeters"
=> Added

- l94: add a comma : "algorithm [27], together"
=> Added

- l95: "set at 200 GeV" --> "set to 200 GeV"
=> Added

- l113: othogonal -> orthogonal
=> Added

- l127: "by cutting on “sub-jettiness”" --> "by cutting on the “sub-jettiness”"
=> There are other jettiness quantities (hence not the)

- l132: unit missing, "p_T > 30" --> "p_T > 30\,GeV"
=>Added

- l133/134: avoid line-break between "than 2"
=>Added

- l138: typo: "form" --> "from"
=>Added

- l168: avoid to have a single-line paragraph on top of the page
=> This will get reformated later

- l173 "orthogonal to the signal *region*"
=> Added

- Figures 2 & 3: the colors for Z+jets and Dibosons are rather similar, at least in my printout. Can more differing colors be chosen? Also the text size in the legend is rather small.
=> We have modified the colors to do this 

- Fig. 3: might be useful to add the p_T cut to the legend.
=> We prefer to not update the plot, asked in LE to remove 

- Fig. 4: why is the plot style different from Figs. 3&4? why is a different model (red dashed line) used in these plots, compared to Figs. 3&4?
=> Fixed
- l176: closing parenthesis after "GeV" is missing
=> Added
- l180 regions -> region
=> Its plural

- l191: the word "vector" seems to be in the mathmode environment (italic font), should be moved outside
=> Fixed

- l191: at the end of the line a full-stop (not comma).
=> Fixed

- l195 "semileptonic W boson decay" -> "leptonic W boson decay"
=> Fixed

- l199 and l203: the numbers 6 and 3 should better be spelled out
=> updated

- would the motivating paragraph 199ff not be fitting better around l180?
=> Its a choice, we could introduce it before the definition of the categories, but here it flows better with teh rest later on

- l208: remove the commas around the N_i formula
=> removed

- l209: remove the comma after the N_i formula
=>removed 
- l213: remove comma after "by"
=>removed
- l216: "equation" should be capitalized
=> Added
- l216: add comma before "respectively"
=> Added
- l222: remove comma
=> Added
- Fig. 5, caption: add comma before "respectively"
=> Added
- Fig. 5: write "E_T^miss" in plot axis labels, not "MET"
=> We will consder
- Fig. 6: in the plot top-labels, write "V-boosted" and "V-resolved" as in the text
=> We will consder
- l248 the space before "3" seems too wide
=> Fixed
- l249: "all of" --> "of all"
=> Fixed
- l259: "and another setting": sentence would be easier to digest by adding a noun and perhaps even a comma, e.g. "and another fit, setting"
=> Fixed
- l271: add comma before "respectively"
=> Fixed
- l275: here "Eq.", l216 "equation" -> unify
=> Fixed
- l332: why are there brackets around "qqbar" but not around "tautau" and "bbbar"?
=> Not changed light qq here is to define light quarks
- l336: "with a large missing transverse" : delete "a"
=> Fixed
- l336: "at centre-of-mass energy" --> "at a centre-of-mass energy"
=> Pefer to keep as is
- Fig. 7, caption: "shown in the orange line" --> "shown by the orange line"
=> Fixed
- Fig. 8, caption: "V-tag categories categories" --> remove once "categories"
  "For the pseudoscalar" : add noun, e.g. "For the pseudoscalar mediator"
  why are there parenthesis around "qqbar" and (tautau) but not around "bbbar"?
=> Fixed, the parnes is for the light quarks denotation
- l341: "categorising ... according to the origin of the jets ... as either quark/gluon radiation or from a hadronically decaying vector boson" : this sounds clumsy. Suggestion : "categorising ... according to the origin of the jets ... as either being quark/gluon radiation or a hadronically decaying vector boson"
=> rephrase (your suggestiond didn't fit perfectly)
- l379, Ref [9]: "Busoni, G." --> "G. Busoni"
=>Fixed
- l392, Ref [14]: "Mar," should be deleted
=>Fixed
