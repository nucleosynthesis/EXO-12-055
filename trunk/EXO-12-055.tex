\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This paper describes a search for dark matter (DM) in events containing at least one 
energetic jet and an imbalance in transverse energy (\ETm) in 
proton-proton (pp) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\TeV. 
The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of  19.7\fbinv collected 
using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

Several astrophysical observations, including the rotational speeds of galaxies~\cite{vandeHulst,Rubin:1980zd,Smoot:1992td}, 
and cosmological considerations~\cite{deBernardis:2000gy,Spergel:2006hy} suggest an abundance of 
a nonbaryonic form of matter in the universe. The existence of DM is one of the most compelling 
sources of evidence for physics beyond the standard model (SM) of particle physics~\cite{Feng:2010gw,Porter:2011nv}.  
In theories that extend the SM, production of DM particles
is expected at the LHC. Monojet searches~\cite{monojet1,monojet2,ATLAS:2012ky,Aad:2011xw,Chatrchyan:2012me,Khachatryan:2016reg} provide  
sensitivity to a wide range of models for DM production at the LHC, while mono-V 
(where V=W or Z boson) searches~\cite{monolep,Aad:2014vka,Aad:2013oja,ATLAS:2014wra} target models with 
associated DM production with SM V-bosons. While the mono-V searches target more specific models, 
they benefit from smaller contributions from SM backgrounds. 
%which can be enhanced in
%theories with non-universal DM couplings~\cite{IVDM}.  
The interpretation of
results from these and other DM searches at the LHC have typically used 
effective field theories that assume heavy mediators, and DM production via
contact interactions~\cite{Fox:2011pm}.  The results of this analysis are
interpreted in the context of a spin-0 or spin-1 mediator decaying to a pair of DM particles 
using a set of simplified DM
models~\cite{simplified1,Buchmueller:2013dya,Buchmueller:2014yoa}, that span a broad range of mediator and DM 
particle properties~\cite{Abercrombie:2015wmb}. These models allow for a comparison in sensitivity with respect to
direct detection (DD) experiments and retain validity as a description of DM
production across the entire kinematic region accessible at the LHC. 

This is the first search at CMS to target the hadronic decay modes of the 
V-bosons in the mono-V channels. The 
mono-V search uses recently developed techniques designed to exploit information 
available in the jet's substructure when the V-boson is 
highly Lorentz-boosted and uses a multivariate V-tagging technique to
identify the individual jets from moderately boosted V-bosons.  

The events are categorised according to the nature of the jets in the
event. The signal extraction is performed by considering the $\ETm$
distribution in each event category, and using multiple data control regions 
to constrain the dominant backgrounds. These updates to the previous CMS monojet 
analysis~\cite{monojet1} yield improvements of roughly 80\% in terms of 
exclusion limits, using the same dataset.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a description of the 
CMS detector and object reconstruction; Section 3 outlines the DM models
explored as signal hypotheses; Section 4 provides a description of 
the event selection and categorisation used in
the search; Section 5 describes the modelling of backgrounds used in the signal
extraction; Section 6 presents the results and interpretations in  
the context of simplified models for DM production.

%===============================================================================
\section{The CMS detector and object reconstruction}

The CMS detector, described in Ref.~\cite{CMSdetector}, is a
multi-purpose apparatus designed to study production processes at high-transverse momentum ($\pt$) 
proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions. 
A superconducting solenoid occupies its
central region, providing a magnetic field of 3.8\unit{T} parallel to the beam
direction. Charged-particle trajectories are measured by the silicon pixel and
strip trackers, which cover a pseudorapidity region of $\abs{\eta} < 2.5$. A
lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a
brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL) surround the tracking volume and
cover $\abs{\eta} < 3$. The steel and quartz-fiber Cherenkov forward (HF)
calorimeter extends the coverage to $\abs{\eta} < 5$. A muon system consists
of gas-ionisation detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the
solenoid, which cover $\abs{\eta} < 2.4$. The first level of the CMS trigger
system, composed of specialised hardware processors, is designed to select the most
interesting events in less than 4\mus, using information from the calorimeters
and muon detectors. The high-level trigger processor farm is used to reduce 
the event rate to a few hundred Hz.  

The particle-flow (PF) algorithm reconstructs and identifies each individual particle 
with an optimized combination of information from the various elements of the CMS 
detector~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001,CMS-PAS-PFT-10-001}. Jets are reconstructed by the 
clustering of PF objects using both the anti-$k_{\textrm{T}}$ algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp} with 0.5 as
the distance parameter (AK5), and the Cambridge$-$Aachen algorithm~\cite{cajets} with
0.8 as the distance parameter (CA8). The jets used in this analysis are required to pass standard 
CMS identification criteria~\cite{jec}. The jet momenta are corrected for contamination from PU  
interactions on the basis of the observed event energy density~\cite{Cacciari:2011ma}. 
Further corrections are then applied to calibrate the absolute scale of the jet energy~\cite{jec}.

The \ETm is defined as the magnitude of the vector sum of the $\pt$ 
of all final state particles that are reconstructed using the PF algorithm.  
Events with a large mis-reconstructed \ETm are removed by applying quality 
filters on the tracker, ECAL, HCAL and muon detector data.


\section{Signal hypotheses} 
\label{sec:signals}
The signal hypotheses  in this search are  a set of simplified
mediator models for DM production~\cite{simplified1,Buchmueller:2013dya,Buchmueller:2014yoa}. 
These models assume the existence of an additional particle, a fermionic dark
matter candidate, and an additional interaction that forces the production of DM.  
In particular, it is assumed that this additional interaction is mediated by a
generic spin-0 or spin-1 particle.  The interactions are characterised by four
distinct Lagrangians, written for a Dirac-fermion DM particle $\chi$
with mass $m_{\mathrm{DM}}$, and a scalar ($\rm{S}$), pseudoscalar ($\rm{P}$), vector ($\rm{Z'}$) or axial vector $\rm{A}$ 
mediator with mass $m_{\mathrm{MED}}$ as, 

\begin{align}\label{eg:LS}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{scalar}}  & \supset - \frac{1}{2} m_{\mathrm {MED}}^2 \mathrm{S}^2 - g_{\mathrm {DM}}  \mathrm{S} \bar{\chi}\chi - g_{\mathrm \mathrm{q}} \sum_{\mathrm{q=b,t}} \frac{m_{\mathrm{q}}}{v} \mathrm{S} \mathrm{\bar{q}q}  - m_{\mathrm {DM}} \bar{\chi}\chi,  \\ \label{eq:LP}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{pseudoscalar}}&\supset -\frac{1}{2}m_{\mathrm MED}^2 \mathrm{P}^2 - ig_{\mathrm {DM}}  \mathrm{P}  \bar{\chi} \gamma^5\chi - i g_{\mathrm{q}}\sum_{\mathrm{q=b,t}} \frac{m_{\mathrm{q}}}{v}  \mathrm{P}  \mathrm{\bar{q}}\gamma^{5}\mathrm{q}  - m_{\mathrm {DM}} \bar{\chi}\chi, \\ \label{eq:LV}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{vector}}&\supset \frac{1}{2}m_{\mathrm MED}^2 \mathrm{Z'}_{\mu} \mathrm{Z'}^{\mu} - g_{\mathrm {DM}}\mathrm{Z'}_{\mu} \bar{\chi}\gamma^{\mu}\chi - g_{\mathrm {SM}} \sum_{\mathrm{q}} \mathrm{Z'}_{\mu} \mathrm{\bar{q}}\gamma^{\mu}\mathrm{q} - m_{\mathrm {DM}} \bar{\chi}\chi, \\ \label{eq:LA}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{axial~vector}}&\supset  \frac{1}{2}m_{\mathrm MED}^2 \mathrm{A}_{\mu} \mathrm{A}^{\mu} - g_{\mathrm {DM}} \mathrm{A}_{\mu} \bar{\chi}\gamma^{\mu}\gamma^5\chi -g_{\mathrm {SM}}\sum_{\mathrm{q}}  \mathrm{A}_{\mu} \mathrm{\bar{q}}\gamma^{\mu}\gamma^{5}\mathrm{q} - m_{\mathrm {DM}} \bar{\chi}\chi,
\end{align}

where $v=246$\GeV is the Higgs potential vacuum expectation value~\cite{Harris:2014hga}. 
For the vector and axial vector mediators, the terms $g_{\mathrm{DM}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{SM}}$ denote the couplings  
of the mediator to the DM particle and to SM particles, respectively.  
In all models considered, these couplings are assumed to be unity ($g_{\mathrm{SM}}=g_{\mathrm{DM}}=1$). 
For the scalar and pseudoscalar models, $g_{\mathrm{q}}=1$ is assumed for all quark flavours, which implies 
a Yukawa coupling of the mediator to the SM fermions.  
The split in terms of axial vector and vector mediators in the Lagrangian is to
parallel the existing separation in DD experiments, into spin-dependent (SD) and
spin-independent (SI) interactions. SI can refer to either vector
or scalar mediated interactions, between which DD experiments cannot distinguish, 
while SD interactions refer to axial vector mediated processes.
 
Pseudoscalar DM-nucleon interaction cross sections are suppressed at non-relativistic DM 
velocities, leading to a limited sensitivity of the DD experiments to this type of interaction~\cite{Haisch:2012kf,LopezHonorez:2012kv}.  
The scalar and pseudoscalar models can be extended by allowing the scalar and pseudoscalar interactions to undergo
electroweak symmetry breaking in an analogous way to the Higgs 
mechanism~\cite{Khoze:2015sra,Hambye:2013sna,Khoze:2014xha,Khoze:2014woa,Altmannshofer:2014vra,Carone:2013wla,Heikinheimo:2013fta}.  
In collider experiments, the production of DM in spin-0 mediated
interactions is predominantly through gluon-fusion via a top-quark loop 
(as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:monoXfeyn}(a)).  When couplings of the mediator to vector bosons are 
present, mono-V 
signatures are produced through a radiative process (of Fig.~\ref{fig:monoXfeyn}(b)). 
The scenario in which couplings between the mediator and vector bosons are not considered, is 
denoted herein as $fermionic$.

For the spin-1 signatures, DM is produced in
an analogous way to Z boson production (as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:monoXfeyn1}). The
mono-V and monojet signatures follow from initial-state radiation (ISR) of a V-boson and 
quark or gluon, respectively. 
For the fermionic models, the width is determined under the minimum width constraint 
requiring that only quarks and DM particles couple to the mediator. For the case in 
which couplings between the mediator and V-bosons are allowed, the width is modified to 
account for the additional contributions that arise~\cite{Harris:2014hga}.

To model the contributions expected from these signals, simulated 
events are generated using {\sc MCFM6.8\cite{mcfm}} for the monojet signature, and
{\sc JHUGen5.2.5}~\cite{Anderson:2013afp} for the V-boson signature.
All signal models are generated at leading order (LO), using  
{\sc Pythia6.4.26}~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za} for parton showers and hadronisation, and {\sc Geant4}~\cite{geant4} for 
simulation of the CMS detector response. For the monojet signal, the generation is performed using the mediator 
mass for the renormalisation and factorisation scales. 
The mediator mass is also used for the scale in the parton showering (PS).  
An alternative choice taking the boson $\pt$ for the PS scale is found to result in reductions of    
$30-80$\% in the expected signal yield in the relevant kinematic region for mediator masses above 400\GeV. 
For scalar and pseudoscalar mediated DM production, the finite top quark mass is taken 
into account for both the inclusive and differential cross sections. {\sc NNPDF3.0} is used to
specify the parton distribution function (PDF) inputs in the signal generation~\cite{Ball:2014uwa}.

To compute the SM background expectation, simulated samples are
produced at LO for the $\Zjets$, $\Wjets$, $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ 
and QCD multijet processes using
{\sc Madgraph5.1.3}~\cite{amcatnlo} interfaced with {\sc Pythia6.4.26a} for
hadronisation and fragmentation, where jets from the matrix element calculations are matched
to the parton shower following the MLM matching
prescription~\cite{Mangano:2006rw}. Additionally a single top quark background 
sample is produced at next-to-leading order (NLO) with {\sc Powheg1.0} ~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,powheg,Alioli:2010xd,Alioli:2009je}, 
and a set of diboson and $\phojets$ samples are  
produced at LO with {\sc Pythia6.4.26a}. All of the simulated background samples are generated using
the {\sc CT10} PDF set~\cite{Gao:2013xoa}.  

The simulated signal and background samples are corrected to
account for the distribution of the number of additional, coincident interactions, 
referred to as pileup (PU), observed in the 8\TeV dataset. All signal and background samples are
additionally corrected to account for the mismodelling of hadronic recoil in
simulation following the procedure described in Ref.~\cite{CMS-PAS-JME-12-002}.

\section{Event selection and categorisation}\label{sec:selection}

Candidate signal events are selected on the basis of large values of 
\ETm and one or more high-\pt jets. 
The data used for this analysis are collected using two \ETm triggers.  
The first requires $\ETm>120$\GeV, where the \ETm is calculated using a PF 
reconstruction algorithm which only uses information from the calorimeters,
while the second requires $\ETm>95$\GeV or $\ETm>105$\GeV, depending on
the data taking period, together with at least one jet with \pt$>80$ \GeV and
$|\eta|<2.6$. 

Events are required to have $\ETm>$200\GeV to ensure a trigger efficiency greater 
than 99\% for all events used in the analysis. 
The azimuthal angle $\phi$ between the \ETm direction and the highest-\pt (leading) jet, $|\Delta\phi(\ETm,\rm{j})|$, is 
required to be larger than 2 radians to reduce the contribution from QCD multijet events.   
Events are vetoed if they contain at least one well-identified electron, photon or muon with
$\pt>10$\GeV, or a $\tau$ lepton with
$\pt>15$\GeV~\cite{Khachatryan:2015iwa,Khachatryan:2015hwa,Khachatryan:2015dfa,Chatrchyan:2013sba}. The
electron, $\tau$ lepton and photon vetoes require that the  
identified object be isolated using standard PF isolation algorithms~\cite{Beaudette:2014cea}.

Selected events are classified according to the
topology of the jets to distinguish between ISR of a quark or gluon,  
and hadronic V-boson decays, which can be either highly Lorentz-boosted or resolved into two jets. 
This results in three orthogonal categories of events that are referred to as the monojet, V-boosted,  
and V-resolved categories. The V-boosted and V-resolved categories are collectively referred to as the V-tagged categories. 

If the V-boson decays hadronically and has sufficiently large~\pt, both its hadronic decay products are captured as 
a single reconstructed ``fat'' jet.  Events in the V-boosted category are
required to have a reconstructed CA8 jet with $\pt>200$\GeV and $\ETm>250$\GeV.  
Further selection criteria are applied to improve the vector boson jet purity by
cutting on the ``N-subjettiness'' ratio $\tau_2/\tau_1$ as defined 
in Refs.~\cite{Thaler:2010tr,Thaler:2011gf}, which identifies jets with a two pronged 
topology, and the pruned jet mass ($m_{\mathrm{prune}}$)~\cite{Ellis:2009me}.
The $\tau_2/\tau_1$ ratio is required to be smaller than 0.5 and $m_{\mathrm{prune}}$ 
is required to be in the range 60$-$110\GeV.  
Events which contain additional jets close to the CA8 jet, but no closer than $\Delta R=\sqrt{\delta\eta^{2}+\delta\phi^{2}} <
0.5$, are selected to include the frequent cases in which ISR 
yields additional jets. If an AK5 jet with $\pt>30$\GeV and $|\eta|<2.5$
is reconstructed, and the azimuthal angle between it and the CA8 jet
is smaller than 2 radians, the event is selected, otherwise it is rejected. Events
with more than one AK5 jet with $\pt>30$\GeV and $|\eta|<2.5$, reconstructed
at $\Delta R> 0.5$ relative to the CA8 jet are rejected.
Figure~\ref{fig:boostvtagvars} shows the distributions in $\tau_2/\tau_1$ and
$m_{\mathrm{prune}}$, before the application of the jet mass selection, in simulation
and data for the V-boosted category. A discrepancy is present in the simulation relative to 
the data, and is attributed to the modelling the parton shower and detector simulation. 
This disagreement is within the systematic uncertainties of the
analysis, a detailed discussion of which can be found in Ref.~\cite{Khachatryan:2014vla}.

and (b) $m_{\mathrm{prune}}$ for CA8 jets. A requirement of $\tau_2/\tau_1 < $ 0.5 has been applied in (b). 
The discrepancy between data and simulation is within systematic uncertainties (not shown). 
The dashed red line shows the expected distribution for scalar-mediated DM production with 
$m_{\mathrm{DM}} = 10$\GeV and $m_{\mathrm{MED}} = 125$\GeV. The gray bands in the bottom panels

of simulated events.}
\label{fig:boostvtagvars}\end{center}\end{figure}

In cases where the V-boson has insufficient boost for
its hadronic decay to be fully contained in a single reconstructed fat jet, a
selection which targets V-boson decays into a pair of AK5 jets is applied to recover
the event if it fails the V-boosted selection. The selection requires that each jet
has $\pt>30$\GeV and $|\eta|<2.5$, and that the dijet system has a mass in the range 
$60-110$\GeV, consistent with originating from a W or Z boson. To reduce
the combinatorial background in the V-resolved category, a multivariate (MVA)  
selection criterion is applied. The inputs to the MVA are a likelihood-based discriminator which 
distinguishes  
quark from gluon jets~\cite{JME-14-002}, the jet pull angle~\cite{Gallicchio:2010sw} 
and the mass drop variable~\cite{Izaguirre:2014ira}. In events where multiple dijet pairs are
found, the pair with the highest MVA output value is taken as the candidate. The
distribution of the MVA output for SM backgrounds and for a scalar
mediator produced in association with either a W or Z boson is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:vtagger}. Events are selected in the V-resolved category in they have an 
MVA output greater than 0.6.

distribution for scalar-mediated DM production with $m_{\mathrm{DM}} = 10$\GeV and $m_{\mathrm{MED}} = 125$\GeV. 
The gray bands in the bottom panels indicate the statistical uncertainty from the limited number

\label{fig:vtagger}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To reduce contamination from top quark backgrounds, events are rejected if they
contain a b-tagged jet, defined using an MVA discriminator, which uses secondary
vertex information and is operated at a medium efficiency working point (``CSV
medium'')~\cite{BTAG}. Finally, the events are required to have $\ETm>250$\GeV. 

The events that do not qualify for either of the two V-tagged categories are
required to have one or two high \pt jets showing characteristics indicative of
originating from a single quark or gluon. This final category is referred to 
as the monojet category. For the monojet category, at
least one AK5 jet within $|\eta|<2$ with $\pt >150$\GeV is required and the event must have $\ETm>200$\GeV.  
Events containing a second AK5 jet with
$\pt>30$\GeV and $|\eta|<2.5$ are selected, providing the azimuthal angle between it and the leading jet with $|\eta|<2$  
is less than 2 radians. This is to allow the frequent cases where
ISR yields two jets.  Events with three or more AK5 jets
with $\pt>30$\GeV and $|\eta|<2.5$ are rejected. Table~\ref{tab:selection} gives a 
summary of the event selection in the three categories. The priority for event selection 
is that events are first selected in the V-boosted category, followed by the 
V-resolved category and finally the monojet category. Events which pass a given selection are not 
allowed to enter any subsequent category.

Figure~\ref{fig:ptandmet} shows the \ETm and leading jet $\pt$ distributions
in data and simulation after selection combining the three event classes combined. The
backgrounds are normalised to an integrated luminosity of 19.7\fbinv. The expected distribution for
vector mediated DM production assuming $m_{\mathrm{DM}}=$10\GeV and $m_{\mathrm{MED}}=$1\TeV 
is overlaid.  
The discrepancy between the data and simulation is a result of
both detector resolution and an imperfect theoretical
description of the kinematics of the $\Vjets$ processes, which are
corrected using control samples in data described in the
following section.

\section{Background estimation}

The presence of DM production will be observable as an excess of events above SM 
backgrounds at high $\ETm$. 
Significant improvements in terms of sensitivity can be
expected if several bins in $\ETm$, yielding the $\ETm$ shape, are considered simultaneously. 
Further improvement is achieved by using control regions in data to 
reduce the uncertainties on the predictions of the SM backgrounds. These regions are
statistically independent from the signal region and designed such that the expected contribution 
from a potential signal is negligible. 
A binned likelihood fit is performed in the ranges 250$-$1000\GeV and 200$-$1000\GeV 
for the two V-tagged, and monojet categories, respectively. The binning is chosen to
ensure each corresponding bin of a set of control regions is populated. The
width of the highest $\ETm$ bin is chosen to provide ease of comparison with the previous
CMS search~\cite{monojet1}. 

The background contributions from $\Zvvjets$ and $\Wlvjets$ is determined using data 
from dimuon and photon, and single muon control regions, respectively. The events in the control regions are
divided into the three categories, using the same selection criteria
described in Section~\ref{sec:selection}, but in addition requiring the presence
of a pair of oppositely charged muons consistent with a Z boson decay, a high
$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ photon or a single muon consistent with a leptonic W boson decay. This 
yields a total of nine control regions; three for each event category. 
In the control regions, the momentum of the dimuon pair,
single muon or the photon is removed and the \ETm~is recalculated. This quantity is 
referred to as pseudo-\ETm~and it is this variable to which the $\ETm$ selection of the 
corresponding signal region applies. The distribution of pseudo-$\ETm$ in 
the control regions is used to estimate the distribution of $\ETm$ expected from the $\Zvvjets$ 
and $\Wlvjets$ backgrounds in the signal region.

The dimuon control region is defined using the same selection as for the signal region, but removing the muon veto. 
Instead, exactly two isolated muons with opposite charge, $\pt^{\mu_{1}},~\pt^{{\mu}_{2}}>20,~10$\GeV and an invariant mass in the range $60-120$~\GeV are required. 
As the decay branching ratio of \Zmm~is approximately six times smaller than that
to neutrinos, the resulting statistical uncertainty in the \Zvvjets~background 
becomes a dominant systematic uncertainty at large values of \ETm.  A
complementary approach is to use events in data that have a high-$\pt$ photon
recoiling against jets to further constrain the \Zvvjets~\cite{zjetspapers}.  
This is advantageous since the production
cross section of \phojets~is roughly a factor of three times that of the \Zvvjets, yielding thereby a
smaller statistical uncertainty in the predicted background. The theoretical uncertainties 
associated to the translation of the kinematics in $\phojets$ events to that of $\Zvvjets$ events 
are however significant. A combination of both photon and dimuon control regions is used 
to maximally constrain the $\Zvvjets$ background.  

The photon control region consists of events that are selected by a trigger requiring an 
isolated photon with $\pt>150$\GeV~\cite{Khachatryan:2015iwa}. 
The selected events are required to have at least one photon with $p_{\mathrm{T}} > 170$\GeV 
and $|\eta|<2.5$, identified using a medium efficiency selection criterion~\cite{Khachatryan:2015iwa}. 
Photons in the ECAL transition 
region, $1.44 <|\eta|< 1.56$ are excluded. All other kinematic selections are the same as the
signal region. The purity of the selection has been measured and is 
used to estimate the contributions from other backgrounds in the photon control region~\cite{Khachatryan:2015iwa}. 

To estimate the $\Wlvjets$ background, a single muon control region is defined by selecting events 
with exactly one muon with $\pt>20$\GeV. Additionally the transverse 
mass, calculated as $m_{\mathrm{T}}=\sqrt{2\ETm p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu} (1-\cos \phi)}$, where $\phi$ 
is the azimuthal angle between the muon and $\ETm$ vector, is required to be in the range $50-100$\GeV.

 
The \ETm spectra of the $\Vjets$ backgrounds are determined through the
use of the binned likelihood fit, to the data in all the bins of the three control regions.
The expected number of events $N_{i}$ in a given bin $i$ of pseudo-\ETm, is defined 
as $N^{{\rm Z}_{\mu\mu}}_{i}=
{{\mu^{\Zvv}_{i}}}/{R^{{\rm Z}}}$ and $N^{\gamma}_{i}=
{{\mu^{\Zvv}_{i}}}/{R^{\gamma}}$ for the dimuon and photon control
regions and  $N^{\rm W}_{i} = {{\mu^{\Wlv}_{i}}}/{R^{\rm W}_{i}}$, for the
single muon control region. The $\mu_{i}^{\Zvv}$ and
$\mu_{i}^{\Wlv}$ terms are free parameters of the likelihood representing
the yields of $\Zvvjets$ and $\Wlvjets$ in each bin of the signal regions. The
additional terms $R^{\rm W}_{i}$, $R^{{\rm Z}|\gamma}_{i}$ denote factors that 
account for the extrapolation of specific backgrounds from the signal region to 
control regions. The likelihood function for a particular event category is
given by   

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\mu}^{\Zvv},\boldsymbol{\mu}^{\Wlv},\boldsymbol{\alpha},\boldsymbol{\beta})
&=        \prod_{i} \mathrm{Poisson}\left(d^{\gamma}_{i}
|B^{\gamma}_{i}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) +\frac{ \mu^{\Zvv}_{i}
}{R^{\gamma}_{i}(\boldsymbol{\beta})}   \right) \\ &~\times
\prod_{i} \mathrm{Poisson}\left(d^{Z}_{i}
|B^{\rm Z}_{i}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})      +\frac{ \mu^{\Zvv}_{i}
}{R^{\rm Z}_{i}     (\boldsymbol{\beta})}       \right ) \\ &~\times
\prod_{i} \mathrm{Poisson}\left(d^{W}_{i}
|B^{\rm W}_{i}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})      +\frac{ \mu^{\Wlv}_{i}
}{R^{\rm W}_{i}     (\boldsymbol{\beta})}       \right),
\numberthis\label{eqn:candclh} \end{align*}

where $d^{\gamma}_{i},~d^{\rm Z}_{i}$ and $d^{\rm W}_{i}$ are the observed number of events in each bin of
the photon, dimuon and single muon control regions and $\mathrm{Poisson}(x|y)=y^{x}e^{-y}/x!$. The terms 
$\boldsymbol{\alpha,\beta}$ denote constrained nuisance parameters, which model systematic uncertainties 
in the translation from the pseudo-$\ETm$ distributions in the control regions of a particular event category 
to the $\ETm$ distribution in the corresponding signal region. The expected contributions
from other background processes in the photon, dimuon and single muon control regions
are denoted $B^{\gamma}$, $B^{\rm Z}$ and $B^{\rm W}$ in Equation (\ref{eqn:candclh}),
respectively.

The factors $R^{\rm Z}_{i}$ account for the ratio of $B(\Zvv)/B(\Zmm)$
and the muon efficiency times acceptance in the dimuon control region, while
$R^{\gamma}_{i}$ account for the ratio of differential cross section between
the $\Zjets$ and $\phojets$ processes, and the efficiency times acceptance of the
photon selection for the $\phojets$ control region. The differential cross sections 
of photon and Z production are corrected using NLO    
K-factors obtained from a comparison of their $\pt$ distributions in events generated
with {\sc Madgraph5\_aMC@NLO 2.2.2}~\cite{amcatnlo}, to the
distributions produced at LO. These K-factors are propagated to the factors 
$R^{\gamma}_{i}$ to account for NLO QCD effects.

Systematic uncertainties are modelled as constrained nuisance parameters
which allow for variation of the factors 
$R^{\gamma}$, $R^{Z}$ and $R^{W}$ in the fit. These include theoretical uncertainties on the photon to Z
differential cross section ratio from renormalisation and factorisation scale
uncertainties, which amount to 8\% each across the relevant boson \pt range. 
These uncertainties are conservative in that they are estimated taking the maximum difference in the ratio due to the  
scale variations for an individual process thereby ignoring any cancellation of the scale uncertainties. 
Electroweak corrections are not accounted for in 
the simulation. Additional K-factors are applied as a function 
of the boson (Z or $\gamma$) \pt, to account for higher order electroweak effects which are around 15\% 
for a boson \pt around 1\TeV~\cite{Kuhn:2005gv}. The full correction is taken as an uncertainty in the 
ratio. A conservative choice is made in assuming this
uncertainty to be uncorrelated across bins of \ETm. The
uncertainties in the muon selection efficiency, photon selection efficiency, and
photon purity are included and fully correlated across the control regions for the three event categories. The results 
of the fit to the data in the control regions for the V-boosted, V-resolved and monojet categories are shown in 
Figs.~\ref{fig:combined_fit_result_VB},~\ref{fig:combined_fit_result_VR}, and~\ref{fig:combined_fit_result_MJ}, respectively.

The remaining backgrounds are expected to be much smaller than those from V$+$jets
and are estimated directly from simulation. Shape and normalisation
systematic uncertainties from the hadronic recoil corrections applied to these
backgrounds are included and account for uncertainties in the jet energy scale and
resolution. A systematic uncertainty of 4\% is included
for the top quark backgrounds normalisation due to the uncertainty of the b-tagging efficiency for
the b jet veto in the V-resolved category~\cite{CMS-PAS-BTV-13-001}. Systematic uncertainties of 7\% and 10\%
are included on the normalisations of the top quark~\cite{Khachatryan:2015oqa} and 
diboson~\cite{tagkey2015250,Khachatryan:2015sga} backgrounds, respectively to account for the uncertainty in their
cross sections in the relevant kinematic phase-space. The top quark and diboson backgrounds have been studied
separately using dedicated control regions in data to validate these
systematic uncertainties. A systematic uncertainty of 50\% is included on the expected 
contribution from QCD multijet events. This uncertainty was obtained by taking the largest differences 
observed between data and simulation in events selected by inverting the requirement on $\Delta(\ETm,\textrm{j})$.
Finally, a systematic uncertainty of 2.6\% in the luminosity measurement~\cite{lumi} is included for all of the  
backgrounds obtained from simulation.

The expected yields in each bin of \ETm from all SM backgrounds,
after the fit to the data in the control regions are given in 
Tables~\ref{tab:bkgboosted},~\ref{tab:bkgmonojet} and \ref{tab:bkgresolved} and for the V-boosted, 
V-resolved and monojet signal region, respectively. 
The uncertainties represent the sum in quadrature of the effects of all the relevant 
sources of systematic uncertainty in each bin of \ETm. 
The correlations of the uncertainties between the different \ETm bins are not 
reflected in these numbers.

\section{Results}
A simultaneous fit to the data in the three event category signal regions is performed,
allowing for systematic uncertainties in the background expectations. 
The corresponding comparisons between the data and the expected backgrounds in the
\ETm distributions after this fit are shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:post_fit_plots}, for each of the three event categories.   
Agreement between the data and the expected backgrounds is observed at the percent level across the three
categories. A local significance of the data in each bin is calculated by
comparing the likelihood between the background-only fit  
(Fig.~\ref{fig:post_fit_plots}) and another fit, fixing the expected total yield of
events in that bin to the observation in data. The largest local significance
observed using this procedure is $1.9$ standard deviations and corresponds to the largest \ETm
bin of the monojet category.

The results are interpreted using the set of simplified models for DM production 
described in Section~\ref{sec:signals}. 
Exclusion limits are set for these models using the asymptotic 
CLs method~\cite{Cowan:2010js,CMS-NOTE-2011-005,cls} with a
profile likelihood ratio as the test statistic in which systematic uncertainties in the signal 
and background models are modelled as constrained nuisance parameters. For each signal hypothesis 
tested, upper limits are placed on the ratio of the signal yield to that predicted by the simplified model, 
denoted as $\mu$. Limits are presented in
terms of excluded regions in the $m_{\mathrm{MED}}-m_{\textrm{DM}}$ plane,
assuming scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector mediators, 
determined as the points for which $\mu>1$ is excluded at least at the 90\% confidence level 
(CL). The choice of determining 90\% CL exclusions is to allow for comparison with other experiments. 
Experimental systematic uncertainties, including jet and \ETm response and
resolution, are included in the signal model as nuisance parameters, while the
theoretical systematic uncertainties on the inclusive cross section (20\% and
30\% for the vector and axial vector, and scalar and pseudoscalar models,
respectively) due to QCD scale and PDF uncertainties are instead added as
additional contours on the exclusion limits. These uncertainties are chosen for 
the full range of the mediator mass from 10\GeV to 3\TeV.

Figure~\ref{fig:masslims} shows the 90\% CL exclusions for the vector,
axial vector, scalar and pseudoscalar mediator models. The 90\%  
upper limit on $\mu$ ($\mu_{\textrm{up}}$), when assuming that the mediator only couples to
fermions (fermionic), is shown by the blue color scale. As described in Section~\ref{sec:signals}, 
the limits are calculated assuming a minimum width for the signal~\cite{An:2012va,Abercrombie:2015wmb,Fox:2011pm,simplified1}. 
For the pseudoscalar interpretation, there is a region of  
masses between 150 and 280\GeV for which the decrease in 
cross section with larger mediator mass is balanced by an increase in acceptance for the 
signal, so that the expected signal contribution remains roughly constant. The expected 
value of $\mu_{\mathrm{up}}$ is larger than 1 for this region, resulting in an  
island at small $m_{\mathrm{DM}}$. No exclusion is expected at the 90\% CL therefore in this region. 
However, the observed value of $\mu_{\mathrm{up}}$ is smaller than 1 throughout this 
region at 90\% CL so no such island appears in the observed limits. 

The results are compared, for all four types of
mediators, to constraints obtained from the observed cosmological relic density
of DM as determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background by the
WMAP and Planck experiments~\cite{Bennett:2003ba,Spergel:2006hy,Planck:2006aa}. The expected DM
abundance is estimated, separately for each model, using a thermal freeze-out
mechanism implemented in {\sc MadDM1.0}~\cite{Backovic:2013dpa}, and compared to the
observed cold DM density $\Omega_c h^2=0.12$~\cite{Ade:2013zuv}, as described in 
Ref.~\cite{Pree:2016hwc}. It is assumed that the simplified model hypothesised 
provides the only relevant beyond SM dynamics for DM interactions.

only to fermions and are not expected to be excluded by this analysis under this

except for the relic density which shows the regions for which $\Omega_c h^2=0.12$, as indicated by the shading.
In all of the models, the mediator width is determined using the minimum width assumption\label{fig:masslims}.}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:xslims}(a)$-$~\ref{fig:xslims}(c) show
the same exclusion contours, this time translated into the planes of
$m_{\textrm{DM}}-\sigma_{\textrm{SI}}$ or $m_{\textrm{DM}}-\sigma_{\textrm{SD}}$, 
where $\sigma_{\textrm{SI}}$ and $\sigma_{\textrm{SD}}$ are
the SI or SD DM-nucleon scattering cross sections. These representations allow for a more direct
comparison with limits from the DD experiments. 
The translations are obtained following the procedures outlines in Ref.~\cite{Malik:2014ggr} 
for the vector and axial vector mediators and Ref.~\cite{ ,Harris:2015kda} for the scalar mediator. 
It should be noted that the limits set from this analysis are only valid
for the simplified model, and in particular assuming
$g_{\textrm{DM}}=g_{\textrm{SM}}=g_{\textrm{q}}=1$. For the scalar mediator model, it is assumed that
only heavy quarks (top and bottom) contribute. Such a choice limits the
sensitivity for DD experiments, but provide direct comparison
between collider and DD experiments without an additional assumption on the
light-quark couplings~\cite{Harris:2015kda}. For the vector and scalar models, the limits are compared with those from the 
LUX experiment~\cite{Akerib:2012ys}. The limits from the LUX experiment currently 
provide the strongest constraints on $\sigma_{\mathrm{SI}}$ for $m_{\rm{DM}} \gtrsim 4$\GeV~\cite{PhysRevLett.116.161301} 
while for smaller values of $m_{\rm{DM}}$, this analysis provides more stringent constraints on the vector and scalar models 
as shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:xslims}(a) and Fig.~\ref{fig:xslims}(c), respectively.  
For axial vector couplings, the limits are compared with DM$-$proton scattering limits
from the PICO-2L~\cite{Amole:2015lsj}, PICO-60~\cite{Amole:2015pla}, IceCube~\cite{Aartsen:2016exj} and 
Super-Kamiokande~\cite{Choi:2015ara} experiments. In this model, the limits obtained in this analysis
are dominant for DM masses up to $300$\GeV.

Pseudoscalar-mediated DM-nucleon interactions are velocity suppressed. The most appropriate
comparison is therefore to the most sensitive bounds on indirect detection
from the Fermi LAT collaboration~\cite{Ackermann:2011wa,Abdo:2010ex}. 
These limits apply to a scenario in which DM annihilates in the center of a galaxy, 
producing a $\gamma$ ray signature. 
The signature can be interpreted as DM  
annihilation to b quark pairs allowing for direct comparison with limits from
this analysis~\cite{Buchmueller:2015eea,Buckley:2014fba,Harris:2014hga}.

Figure~\ref{fig:xslims}(d) shows the exclusion contours assuming pseudoscalar
mediation in the plane of DM pair annihilation cross section versus
$m_{\textrm{DM}}$. It is assumed that only heavy quarks 
contribute in the production of the mediator while for the
interpretation of the Fermi LAT limits in the annihilation cross section, it is assumed
that the mediator only decays to b quark pairs. As with all of the simplified model interpretations, 
the DM particle is assumed to be a Dirac fermion. 
The results shown from Fermi LAT have been scaled by a factor of two compared 
to Ref.~\cite{Ackermann:2011wa} to translate the assumption of a Majorana DM 
fermion used in that analysis. 

An excess in $\gamma$ ray emission, consistent with the annihilation of DM, at the galactic 
centre has been reported in several studies using data from Fermi LAT~\cite{Gordon:2013vta,Abazajian:2012pn,Hooper:2010mq}. 
Further studies of this excess suggest that DM 
annihilation could be mediated by a light pseudoscalar~\cite{Agrawal:2014oha,Calore:2014nla}. 
The 68\% CL preferred regions in this plane assuming the annihilation of DM
pairs to light-quarks ($\mathrm{q\bar{q}}$), $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ or $\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$, 
using data from Fermi LAT, are shown as solid colour regions in Fig.~\ref{fig:xslims}(d).  
For the simplified model, and assuming that $g_{\mathrm{DM}}=g_{\mathrm{q}}=1$, 
all of these regions are excluded by this analysis. The limits from this analysis are 
exceed those from Fermi LAT for $m_{\mathrm{DM}}<100$\GeV.

\section{Summary} 
A search has been presented for an excess of events with at least one 
energetic jet in association with large $\ETm$ in a
data sample of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\TeV. The
data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7\fbinv collected with the CMS
detector at the LHC. Sensitivity to a potential mono-V signature is
achieved by the addition of two event categories which select hadronically decaying V-bosons 
using novel jet substructure techniques.
This search is the first at CMS to use jet substructure
techniques to identify hadronically decaying vector bosons in both
Lorentz-boosted and resolved scenarios.  
The sensitivity of the search has been increased compared to the previous CMS result by using
the full shape of the $\ETm$ distribution to discriminate signal from standard
model backgrounds and through additional data control regions. 
No significant deviation is observed relative to the expectation from
SM backgrounds in the \ETm distributions. The results of the search
are interpreted under a set of simplified models, that describe the production
of DM particle pairs via vector, axial vector, scalar or pseudoscalar mediation and constraints
on their parameter space are placed. The search excludes DM production via vector or axial 
vector mediation with mediator masses up to 1.5\TeV, within the simplified model assumptions. When 
compared to DD experiments, the limits from this analysis provide the strongest constraints at 
small DM masses. For scalar and pseudoscalar 
mediated DM production, this analysis excludes mediator masses up to 80\GeV and 
400\GeV, respectively. The search is the first at CMS to be interpreted using the  
simplified models for DM production.
