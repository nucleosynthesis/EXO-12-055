Figures :
12) Figs.2-4 and 6, in the legend of each plot, 
  (a) the 1st letter on each line should be in the upper case, e.g.
"top" -->
"Top"
  (b) the 2nd word on each line should be in the lower case, e.g.
"... Mediator" -->
"... mediator"

=> updated

(14) Fig.3, the labels of "pT < 160 GeV" and "pT > 160 GeV" should be added
into somewhere of the plots (a) and (b), so that readers can quickly see the
differences between two plots even without reading the caption.

=> already removed by the LE 

(19) Fig.5

  (a) At the upper-left corners above the three upper plots and the horizontal 
axis labels of all plots, the 1st letters should be in the upper case, i.e.

at the upper-left corners:

"monojet category" -->
"Monojet category"

in the horizontal axis labels: (also the "MET" should be changed to "EmissT")

"fake MET [GeV]" -->
"Fake EmissT [GeV]"


=> updated

(25) Fig.6, in addition to the item (12) above for the cases of letter in the
legend, at the upper-left corner above each plot, the 1st letter should be in
the upper case, e.g.

the upper-left plot:
"monojet category" -->
"Monojet category"

etc.


=> updated

(26) Figs.7 and 8, 

  (a) In the legends of all plots, the non-leading words should be in the lower
case, e.g.

the upper-left plot of Fig.7:

"Median Expected ...
 +/- Scale Uncertainty
 Observed
 LUX
 Planck+WMAP Relic" -->

"Median expected ...
 +/- Scale uncertainty
 Observed
 LUX
 Planck+WMAP relic"

All other plots should be changed similarly.

=> updated 

-----------------
Page 1

(1) L10-11,
  (a) two commas may be better to be replaced by brackets and a word of "where"
is added, 
  (b) two spaces should be added before and after the symbol "=", i.e.

"while mono-V, V=W or Z boson, searches [3–6] target ..." -->
"while mono-V (where V = W or Z boson) searches [3–6] target ..."

=> prefer to keep as is, minimize verbosity

(2) L14, as the "EFT" has not been used afterward in whole paper, it eventually
can be removed, i.e."(EFT) that assume heavy mediators and ..." -->
"that assume heavy mediators and ..."

 => updated


(3) L34, the "pT" should be explained at its 1st appearance in text here, i.e.
"study high-pT physics processes in ..." -->
"study high-pT (transverse momentum) physics processes in ..."

=> updated

Page 2

(4) Eqs.(1)-(4), in the term after the Sigma-summation symbol of each Eq., the
subscript "SM" of "gSMq" should change the font to be consistent in this paper,
i.e.
"gSM(italic)q" -->
"gSM(non-italic)q"

=> Nice catch (updated)

(5) L54, the duplication of "coupling" on this line can be fixed by removing
the 1st one, i.e. "The couplings gDM and gSM denotes the coupling of" -->
"The gDM and gSM denotes the coupling of"

=> updated
 
(6) L57, L67 and L74, three places may be shortened from
  (a) L57: 
"into spin-dependent and spin-independent" -->
"into spin-dependent and -independent"

=> We prefer to keep as is

  (b) L67:
"the production of Dark Matter in spin-0 mediated ..." -->
"the production of DM in spin-0 mediated ..."

=> Updated

  (c) L74:
"Yukawa coupling to standard model particles." -->
"Yukawa coupling to SM particles."

=> Given DM is used in the same sentance, we prefer to keep as is

(7) L68, an extra space after "Fig." may should be removed, i.e.

"loop (Fig.  1(a))." -->
"loop (Fig.1(a))."

=> updated

(8) L79, I'm not sure whether a word of "the" should be added, i.e.

"are generated at leading order," -->
"are generated at the leading order,"

 => we prefer to keep as is

Page 3

(9) L82, to be consistent with the tense in this Section, a verb "was" may
should be changed from

"choice was found to be up to 30% ..." -->
"choice is found to be up to 30% ..."

=> updated
 

Page 4

(10) L103, L124, and L133-134, three places may be shortened from

  (a) L103: (to reduce the number (i.e. three) of the words of "of")

"as the magnitude of the negative vector sum of 
the transverse momenta of all final state particles," -->

"as the magnitude of the negative vector pT sum of 
all final state particles,"

=> we prefer to keep as is


  (b) L124:
"has sufficiently high transverse momentum," -->
"has sufficiently high pT,"

=> updated

  (c) L133-134: (also, as an angle can be measured in either the radians or
degrees, therefore, the unit of phi may should be specified)

"is smaller than 2," -->
"is < 2 radians,"

=> updated 

(11) L128 and L131, 

  (a) readers may appreciate it if the name of the variable "tau" can be
mentioned around L128;

=> its described one setence earlier, we prefer to leave it as is

  (b) the name of the variable "DeltaR" may should be given on L131, i.e.

"but no closer than DeltaR < 0.5," -->
"but no closer than a 2-dimensional radius DeltaR < 0.5,"

 => We prefer to leave it as is

Pages 5-16

(12) Figs.2-4 and 6, in the legend of each plot, 

  (a) the 1st letter on each line should be in the upper case, e.g.
"top" -->
"Top"

=> updated

  (b) the 2nd word on each line should be in the lower case, e.g.
"... Mediator" -->
"... mediator"

=> updated

(13) L157-158, 173-176, L185, L189, L213, L231, L282, L291, Tables 1-3's
caption (the 1st lines) and L323, the shortening may be made on these lines,
i.e.
 (a) L157-158: (and an article word of "a" should be changed or removed)

"with pT greater than 150 GeV and a EmissT greater than 200 GeV ..." -->
"with pT > 150 GeV and an EmissT > 200 GeV ..." 
or
"with pT > 150 GeV and EmissT > 200 GeV ..."

=>  We will abstain from implementing, since we feel  that a less dense use of symbols improves reading

  (b) L173-176: (three places; also a closing bracket should be added at the
end of L176) 

"by adding control regions, regions which are orthogonal to the signal with
negligible contributions expected from signal, to simultaneously constrain the
predictions of the standard model background. A binned likelihood fit is
performed in the range 250-1000 GeV (200-1000" -->

"by adding the control regions, which are orthogonal to the signal with
negligible contributions expected from signal, to simultaneously constrain the
predictions of the SM background. A binned likelihood fit is 
performed in the range 250 (100)-1000"

  (c) L185:
"photon with transverse momentum greater than 150 GeV." -->
"photon with pT > 150 GeV."

=> updated

  (d) L189:
"with exactly one muon with pT larger than 20 GeV." -->
"with exactly one muon with pT > 20 GeV."

=> not updated

  (e) L213:
"signal region to control regions." -->
"signal to control regions."

=> prefer to separate since one is plurual and others are signular

  (f) L231:
"the uncertainty in the muon selection efficiency, photon selection efficiency"
-->
"the uncertainty in the muon and photon selection efficiencies"

=> prefer to keep this separated since we don't select a muon and a photon, we do either

  (g) L282 and L323: (two places)
"dark matter" -->
"DM"

=> updated

  (h) L291:
"The expected 90% confidence level upper limit on ..." -->
"The expected 90% CL upper limit on ..."

=> We leave as is

  (i) Tables 1-3's caption (the 1st lines):

"Expected yields of the standard model processes and ..." -->
"Expected yields of the SM processes and ..."

 => we leave as is


(14) Fig.3, the labels of "pT < 160 GeV" and "pT > 160 GeV" should be added
into somewhere of the plots (a) and (b), so that readers can quickly see the
differences between two plots even without reading the caption.

=> updated

 (15) From L179 to L219, to be consistent with the good examples in this paper
(e.g. on 

L115,
L167,
L206,
L236 and 
Table 1-3 (the header row), etc.)

the spaces before and after the symbol "+" in all the expressions 
of "xxx  +  jet", etc. should be removed, e.g.

L179: (two places)

"from Z(nunu)  +  jets (W(lnu)  +  jets) is determined ..." -->
"from Z(nunu)+jets (W(lnu)+jets) is determined ..."

=> updated

Other places where also need to be changed by the similar way are

L188,
L198 (two places),
L200,
L202-204 (three places),
L211 (two places),
L219-220 (three places), etc.


=> updated

 (16) L186 and L190, to be consistent with elsewhere in this paper, the font of
the subscript "T" in "pT" or "pmuT" at two places should be changed from

"italic" -->
"non-italic"

=> updated 


(17) L199, as the "BR" has been used on L217, it should be explained at its 1st
appearance in text here, i.e.
"As the decay branching ratio of ..." -->
"As the decay branching ratio (BR(italic)) of ..."

=> Not sure this is needed for just one use of branching ratio

(18) L216 and L275, to be consistent with all other CMS papers, the Equation
index should be put into a bracket, i.e. 

(a) L216: (also, I'm not sure whether a word of "as" should be added)

"are denoted Bgamma, BZ and BW in equation 5 respectively." -->
"are denoted as Bgamma, BZ and BW in Eq.(5) respectively."

=> updated (no as)

  (b) L275:
"under the Lagrangians given in Eq. 1." -->
"under the Lagrangians given in Eq.(1)."

 => updated

(19) Fig.5

  (a) At the upper-left corners above the three upper plots and the horizontal 
axis labels of all plots, the 1st letters should be in the upper case, i.e.

at the upper-left corners:

"monojet category" -->
"Monojet category"

in the horizontal axis labels: (also the "MET" should be changed to "EmissT")

"fake MET [GeV]" -->
"Fake EmissT [GeV]"

=> updated

  (b) In the caption, the 4-5th lines, the colors of red and blue are
mentioned, but can not be displayed in black-white; the problem can be solved
by using different line styles (e.g. solid line and dash line, etc.)
 
=> updated
 

(20) L253, to be consistent with the tense in this Section, the verb "was"
should be changed from

"A simultaneous fit was performed to ..." -->
"A simultaneous fit is performed to ..." or
"A simultaneous fit has been performed to ..."

 => updated

(21) L266, L311, Figs.7 and 8's captions, in each 2-D pairs, it will be looked
better if two spaces before and after the "-" are removed, i.e.

  (a) L266:
"regions in the mMED  -  mDM plane," -->
"regions in the mMED-mDM plane,"

=> updated

  (b) L311:
"of mDM  -  sSI/SD," -->
"of mDM-sSI/SD,"

=> updated

  (c) Fig.7's caption, the 1st line: (also the subscript "med" should be in the
upper case, to be consistent with elsewhere in this paper)

"mmed  -  mDM plane ..." -->
"mMED-mDM plane ..."

=> updated

  (d) Fig.8's caption, the 1st line:
"in the mDM  -  sigmaDM plane ..." -->
"in the mDM-sigmaDM plane ..."

 => updated

 (22) L267, the "CL" should be explained at its 1st appearance in text here,
i.e.
"is excluded at 90% CL or more." -->
"is excluded at 90% Confidence Level (CL) or more."

=> updated
 

(23) L288, the variables "Ohmigac" and "h" may should be explained briefly,
i.e.
"Ohmigac*h2 = 0.12 [63] ..." -->
"Ohmigac*h2 = 0.12 [63] (where Ohmigac is ... and h is ...) ..."

=> The DM density is  Ohmigac*h2, its one term, no need for splitting

(24) Tables 1-3, 

  (a) in the header row of each Table, 

    (i) in the 1st column, to be consistent in this paper, the subscript and
superscript of EmissT, the "bin" and the unit should change the font, i.e.

"EmissT(italic) bin(italic)(GeV(italic))" -->
"EmissT(non-italic) bin(non-italic)(GeV(non-italic))"

=> updated

    (ii) in the 3rd column, the 2nd word should be in the lower case, i.e.
"Total Bkg" -->
"Total bkg"

=> updated

    (iii) in the 5th column, the 1st letter should be in the upper case, i.e.
"top" -->
"Top"

=> updated

  (b) All three Tables have the identical header row, and almost identical
captions except one word each; thus they may be combined with replacing two
header rows of Tables 2 and 3 by two double border lines, and with an extended
caption of Table 1, 


i.e. (together with the item (13i) above for "SM", and the "region" to be      
     plural)

"Table 1: Expected yields of the standard model processes and their
uncertainties per bin for the monojet 
category signal region after" -->

"Table 1: Expected yields of the SM processes and their 
uncertainties per bin for the monojet (upper Table), V-resolved (middle Table)
and V-boosted (lower Table) 
category signal regions after"

=> we prefer to keep the separated, combining them all woud take up too much space to fit on one page
 

(25) Fig.6, in addition to the item (12) above for the cases of letter in the
legend, at the upper-left corner above each plot, the 1st letter should be in
the upper case, e.g.

the upper-left plot:
"monojet category" -->
"Monojet category"

etc.

 
(26) Figs.7 and 8, 

  (a) In the legends of all plots, the non-leading words should be in the lower
case, e.g.

the upper-left plot of Fig.7:

"Median Expected ...
 +/- Scale Uncertainty
 Observed
 LUX
 Planck+WMAP Relic" -->

"Median expected ...
 +/- Scale uncertainty
 Observed
 LUX
 Planck+WMAP relic"

All other plots should be changed similarly.

=> updated

  (b) In the caption of Fig.7, the 1st line, the 3rd word should be in the
lower case, i.e. (together with the item (21c) above for the spacing and the
subscript "med")

"Figure 7: 90% CL Exclusion contours in the mmed  -  mDM plane ..." -->
"Figure 7: 90% CL exclusion contours in the mMED-mDM plane ..."

=> updated

Page 17

(27) L344 and L346, according to the guidelines of CMS PubComm, some acronyms
in the Summary Section may should be spelled out at their 1st appearance in the
Section, i.e.


"from SM backgrounds is observed in the EmissT
...
describe the production of DM via vector," -->

"from Standard Model backgrounds is observed in the EmissT
...
describe the production of dark matter via vector,"


=> updated

(28) After L348, the Acknowledgment Section is missing, it should be added
without needing the Section index number.

 => Added the standard letters versoin

 
Pages 18-22, in the References Section,

(29) L360, in [3], to be consistent in this Section, the spaces should be added

it may be fixed by changing from "article" to "unpublished" in the bib file.

=>  updated

(35) L388, in [12], the last word on the line in the article title should be in
the lower case, i.e.

"[25] T. Sjostrand, ..." -->
"[25] T. Sjo(with two dots on the top of "o")strand, ..."

=> updated

(38) L423, in [26], it may be looked better if the hyphen in the article title
is extended to a long dash symbol, i.e.

"GEANT4 - a simulation toolkit" -->
"GEANT4 --- a simulation toolkit"

Another one which also needs to be changed by the similar way is [50].

=> updated
 

(39) L426, in [27], to be consistent with other PAS Refs. (e.g. [41], etc.) in
this Section, the document index should be changed from

"Technical Report CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001, CERN, 2009" -->
"CMS Physics Analysis Summary CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001, 2009"

Other ones which also need to be changed by the similar way are [29], [45] and
[50].

=> updated

(40) L427, in [28], the 
"k(t)" in the article title is expressed differently from L97 where it is
"kT".
I'm not sure whether they should be consistent.

 => updated

(41) L478, in [47], to be consistent in this Section, a space should be added
after the symbol "=" in the article title at the end of line, i.e.

"sqrt(s) =8" -->
"sqrt(s) =  8"

 => updated

(42) L489-490, in [51], to be consistent with all other CMS papers on JPG
Refs., the journal name can be shortened from

"J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 28 (2002) 2693," -->
"J. Phys. G28 (2002) 2693,"

 => updated
 

(43) L518, in [62], to be consistent in this Section, all references should
have only one page index instead of two, i.e.

"Phys. Dark Univ. 5-6 (2014) 18,"

=> updated
