l.82. Please, clarify "... to be up to 30% in the expected signal yield..."

What is 30 % ? Difference between what and what setup ?

 This is now clarifed. It is relating the difference in the total signal yield changing the hadronisation scale from the mediator mass to the pt of the mediator.

l.101 remove "Data-driven". Corrections are based both of MC (absolute) and

data (for residual data/MC difference).
Done

l.241 Please, provide an arguments here about QCD uncertaunty of 50% even if you refer

to the previous analysis [1].

Added a sentence to mention the Data/MC comparison in inverted selection region used to determine 50%

ll.267-273 Did you take into account the theoretical uncertainty of the signal acceptance ?

 Yes, but these are by far much smaller than the variation from the scale uncertainties on the cross-section

Fig.2: What is a meaning of dashed areas around MC histogram in fig. (b)?

 This is (now) explained in the caption. They are MC Stat uncertainties

Fig.7. Instead of limits on the signal strength it would be good to have the limits

on the cross-sections. It will be more useful then for theorists.

 true, but also not possible in a “shape” analysis. We assume a model (the simplified model) and it is that we which do/do not exclude.

l.24 remove "of"

Done

ll.27-30. Section 2 in a description of CMS detector. Other section numbers should be increased by one (Section i => Section i+1)

 Done, thanks

l.100 "jets are corrected for pileup" => "the jet energy is corrected for

the contribution from pileup"

 Detail added

l.113 "othogonal" -> "orthogonal"

 Fixed

Fig.6: "resolved" -> "V-resolved", "boosted" -> "V-boosted" in the titles

of fig.(b) and (c)

Done

With kind regards,

A.Nikitenko and V.Gavrilov for ITEP
